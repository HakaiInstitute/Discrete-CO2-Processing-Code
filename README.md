# Discrete-CO2-Processing-Code
Matlab scripts for post-processing of discrete CO2 data.
The first Matlab script 'SRVC_CO2_Carb_Calcs' calculates the carbonate parameters from analyzed discrete CO2 samples. The code outputs: corrected alakalinity, in-situ pCO2, pH, aragonite and calcite saturation states, and pCO2 calculated at a common temp of 20ÂºC.
